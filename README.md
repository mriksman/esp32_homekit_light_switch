# esp32-c3-homekit-light-switch

ESP32-C3 program designed to be installed on AiThinker's ESP-C3-12F; an ESP32-C3 replacement module for ESP8266/TYWE3S used in many smart switches.

The ESP8266/TYWE3S only has 1MB flash, which made programming and OTA difficult.

Remove the existing TYWE3S module and replace with one of these to get more flash space, and the latest Espressif updates to the SDK. 

Goodbye ESP8266/TYWE3S!
